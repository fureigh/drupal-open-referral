Drupal Ohana API
================

A Drupal-based approach to sharing social service data, in the spirit of Ohana API and Open Referral.

# Vision
All over the world, organizations and individuals create valuable lists of community resources (social services, etc.)... then face the challenge of keeping them up-to-date. Inspired by [Open Referral](http://www.openreferral.org) and [Ohana API](http://www.ohanapi.org), we dream of developing an open system that makes community resource data easier to manage, find and share. Of the tools currently available, most require developers for making even the smallest customizations or saddle the organization with ongoing licensing costs. Our solution will be freely available and simple for not-so-technical people to deploy, customize and maintain through the browser in order to lower the bar for adoption and improve the usefulness of the end product. To that end, we plan to build it as a packaged Drupal-based solution.

We’re building Drupal Open Referral (working title) with reference to the great work done by the Ohana API Team and the Human Standards Data Specification. By doing so, we’ll set the stage for data exchange with other systems that adopt the Ohana standard, ultimately reducing the burden on each organization to manage their resource data independently.

# Who's working on this?
@fureigh and @kaypro4

# Needs
We’re currently scoping and doing technical planning. Want to work on Drupal theming, distribution development, or porting contributed modules to Drupal 8? This is a great chance! Once this shapes up a bit more, we’ll also need design guidance and documentation/tutorial writing.
